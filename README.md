# Dictionary-using-AVL-tree
Implemented a dictionary by AVL tree. Word is used as the key of an entry.Entry is comprised of the pair(word,meaning).Nodes of the AVL tree are pointers to entry. Words are compared lexicographically.<br/>
Project supports the following functionalities:<br/>
->add a word in the dictionary<br/>
->remove a word from the dictionary</br>
->search a word in the dictionary,if the word is present,then it will return its meaning<br/>
->size (returns the number of enteries in the dictionary)<br/>
->print all the words in the level order of the AVL tree</br>
->count in range : returns all the words between the keys k1 and k2(comparison is done lexicographically)</br>
